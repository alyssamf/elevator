# Alyssa Feagans 7/6/2023 - Outside Analytics Elevator Problem

## Python solution
    Assuming input is an integer array with the first value being the starting floor. 
    Returns a string in format = "TOTAL_TRAVEL_TIME FLOOR, FLOOR, FLOOR"

    Dependencies: python >= 3.0
    Runtime: O(n) where n is length of input array (num of floors to visit)

    To run python script:
    $ python3 python/elevator.py 

### TODOS:
- ~~Python - return output instead of printing~~
- Write tests for python solution
- Write a solution as a bash script
- Write a solution in Java
- Write a solution in C
